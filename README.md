# Flutter | Hometask #1

Your task is to create a todo CLI app in Dart. The list is controlled by the ToDoList class. Via this class you can add elements to it, add many elements at once, remove elements by id.
Tasks can be of several types but all of them implement the Task interface. Plain tasks contain id, task name and task category. Recurring tasks have also dayOfTheWeek property - filled by one of the values from an enum.
There should be a method which returns a task category summary - which categories of tasks are present and how many tasks are in each of them.


The goal of the task is to let you get better acquainted with the Dart language so you should ideally read the whole language tour documentation, donâ€™t cut corners.

While working on your task you should utilize all of the following Dart features:
- Data structures
- List
- Map
- Enum 
- Generics
- Null-aware spread operator
- Collection if / for
Classes, variables
- Abstract class + Implicit interface
- Static method
- Required parameters in methods
- Final variables

Another skill you should practice is working with Git and Github. Implement the following git requirements while completing the task in Dart.
